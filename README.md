Analysis of recorded Strava cycling activities

### Recordings of my activities
Strava is where I record most of my sports activities, which consist mainly of cycling. Not only do I have GPS enabled, I often also wear a heart rate monitor around my chest or wrist, have a speed sensor mounted on my front wheel axle and a cadence sensor on the arm of my crankset.
